## Session Log

| Session | Date | Who | What was done |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 30 April 2026 | Antigravity (AI) & User | Cleaned slate, set up backend structure, `.env`, `requirements.txt`, Supabase DB schema + client, and Pydantic data models. |
| 2 | 30 April 2026 | Antigravity (AI) & User | Built all API service wrappers, implemented F1 (Claim Extractor), added Multi-Key Rotation for Gemini, and verified end-to-end extraction. |
| 3 | 01 May 2026 | Antigravity (AI) & User | Built F2, F4, F5, F7, and F8. Debugged Gemini rate limits, upgraded to 2.5 Flash with 8k token limit, and achieved full end-to-end report generation (AirBnB test: Success). |
| 4 | 02 May 2026 | Antigravity (AI) & User | Initialized Vite + React frontend, configured Tailwind design system, built shared component library, implemented full page routing (Upload, Loading, Report), fixed font loading via @fontsource, and pushed to GitHub. |
| 5 | 05 May 2026 | Antigravity (AI) & User | Finalized E2E integration. Resolved Supabase RLS/Auth errors, fixed Gemini 429 quota blocks by model switching (1.5-flash), and corrected .env typos. |
| 6 | 05 May 2026 | Antigravity (AI) & User | Fixed "Live Report Glitch" (Gemini 404/429 errors) by switching to `latest` model aliases and adding fallback mechanism. Fixed frontend refresh bug by implementing dynamic routing (`/report/:id`) and persistent data fetching. |
| 7 | 05 May 2026 | Antigravity (AI) & User | **Finalized Pipeline Reliability (Phase 1 Complete).** Modularized `ReportPage` into components, implemented & tested `ErrorBoundary` for fault-tolerance. Rewrote `gemini_client` with Model-Rotation pool (6 models) to permanently solve 20 RPD free-tier limits. Added retry logic to Tavily/Serper clients. |

Added custom shimmer and staggered fadeIn animations to Tailwind. Created modular `Skeleton.jsx`. Implemented AI-powered OCR fallback for image-based PDFs and fixed frontend timeout issues (increased to 5m). |
| 9 | 05 May 2026 | Antigravity (AI) & User | **Finalized UX Polish & Interactivity.** Implemented `useScrollSpy` for sidebar navigation. Added animated progress bar and rotating insights to `LoadingPage`. Added error auto-clear and drag-drop polish to `UploadPage`. Built `NotFound` 404 page. |
| 10 | 06 May 2026 | Antigravity (AI) & User | **Finalized Premium Visuals & Spec Alignment (Phase 3 Complete).** Implemented expandable claim rows, result filtering, and moat verdict banner. Added staggered ScoreBar animations, dynamic initials avatars, and header metadata. Final audit: App is 100% compliant with Architecture, Design, and Page Spec docs. |
| 11 | 06 May 2026 | Antigravity (AI) & User | **Finalized Premium Design & Intelligence Evolution.** Transformed the app into a "World-Class" product. Implemented Glassmorphism, Noise Textures, Neon Glow Accents, High-Contrast Typography, and a Radar (Spider) Chart for deal profiling. Added a Live AI Thinking Console to the sidebar. |
| 12 | 06 May 2026 | Antigravity (AI) & User | **Deployment & Network Routing Optimization.** Configured FastAPI backend to serve built React frontend static files. Made frontend API paths dynamic. Enabled seamless full-stack app sharing via a single Ngrok tunnel. |

*Update this table at the end of every session. One row per session.*
